                    <p>The master project presents a complex system of neural networks, which based on the input image
                        generates a text description in simple English with very few coded assumptions.</p>
                    <p>The system was created based on researched current trends in the subject of automatic generation
                        of descriptions for photos and is based on the encoder-decoder architecture. The architecture
                        consists of two neural networks: a convolutional neural network, which encodes the image into a
                        compact representation, and a recurrent neural network, which generates the appropriate sentence
                        from the representation received from the first network.</p>
                    <p> The model has been trained to maximise the probability of obtaining the correct sentence
                        describing the input image. The correctness of the generated descriptions of the images was
                        assessed through appropriate assessment indicators: CIDER, BLEU4, BLEU3, BLEU2, BLEU1, ROUGE,
                        METEOR, SPICE.</p>
