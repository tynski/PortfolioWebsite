                    <p>The paper presents different approaches to the design and implementation of complete
                        classification
                        systems. The system attempts to unambiguously divide patients into healthy and sick based on
                        multidimensional vectors of characteristics describing human voice. For this purpose, 1 374
                        recordings of extended vowels /a/, /i/, /u/ in normal tone were used. The data set was taken
                        from
                        the Saarbruecken Voice Database (SVD). A binary classification model was designed, which
                        segregates
                        patients into healthy and sick.
                    </p>
                    <p> Several versions of parameter vectors extracted from the audio signal in the time, frequency and
                        cepstral domain were presented and tested. The final version of the proposed classification
                        system
                        is composed of a vector of 17 parameters. The research presents possible solutions together with
                        their qualitative evaluation. The system has been implemented in Python language and
                        scikit-learn
                        library.
