                <p>The paper presents different approaches to the design and implementation of complete classification
                    systems. The system attempts to unambiguously divide patients into healthy and sick based on
                    multidimensional vectors of characteristics describing human voice. For this purpose, 1 374
                    recordings of extended vowels /a/, /i/, /u/ in normal tone were used. The data set was taken from
                    the Saarbruecken Voice Database (SVD). A binary classification model was designed, which segregates
                    patients into healthy and sick.

                    Several versions of parameter vectors extracted from the audio signal in the time, frequency and
                    cepstral domain were presented and tested. The final version of the proposed classification system
                    is composed of a vector of 17 parameters. The research presents possible solutions together with
                    their qualitative evaluation. The system has been implemented in Python language and scikit-learn
                    library.
