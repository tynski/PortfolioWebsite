                <p>The master project presents a complex system of neural networks, which based on the input image
                    generates a text description in simple English with very few coded assumptions. The system was
                    created based on researched current trends in the subject of automatic generation of descriptions
                    for photos and is based on the encoder-decoder architecture. The architecture consists of two neural
                    networks: a convolutional neural network, which encodes the image into a compact representation, and
                    a recurrent neural network, which generates the appropriate sentence from the representation
                    received from the first network. The model has been trained to maximise the probability of obtaining
                    the correct sentence describing the input image. The correctness of the generated descriptions of
                    the images was assessed through appropriate assessment indicators: CIDER, BLEU4, BLEU3, BLEU2,
                    BLEU1, ROUGE, METEOR, SPICE.</p>
